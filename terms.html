      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="updated"><em>Effective date: December 31, 2025 · Last updated: December 31, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Two Ducks mobile application and related services
        (collectively, the “Service”). By downloading, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
        If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is operated by <strong>Prathap Kasina</strong> (“Two Ducks,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
        You can contact us at <a href="mailto:team@twoducksapp.com">team@twoducksapp.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you live) to use the Service.
        By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement.
      </p>

      <h2>3) What the Service does (and doesn’t)</h2>
      <p>
        Two Ducks is designed to help couples privately indicate when they are “Open” to connection and learn only when both
        partners match. The Service is provided for personal, informational, and relationship-support purposes only.
        <strong>It is not medical, mental health, or professional advice</strong>. If you have concerns about your health,
        safety, or relationship, seek qualified professional help.
      </p>

      <h2>4) Accounts and Sign in with Apple</h2>
      <p>
        You may create an account using Apple’s authentication (“Sign in with Apple”). Apple may allow you to share (or hide)
        your email address and to set or edit the name you share. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
        your device and login method and for all activity under your account.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Partner pairing and shared features</h2>
      <p>
        Some features require pairing with a partner. When you pair, certain information and app signals may be shared between
        paired partners to enable the Service (for example, whether a mutual match occurred and basic pairing metadata).
        You should only pair with someone you trust and who consents to be paired.
      </p>
      <div class="notice">
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> The Service is intended for consensual use. Do not use it to harass, pressure, manipulate,
          surveil, or coerce another person.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>6) Your responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service lawfully and respectfully.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to reverse engineer, interfere with, or disrupt the Service.</li>
        <li>Do not upload or transmit malware or abusive content.</li>
        <li>Do not use the Service in a way that violates another person’s privacy, rights, or consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7) Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and protect information.
        By using the Service, you agree to our Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Subscriptions, payments, and trials (if offered)</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features may require a paid subscription (“Subscription”). Prices, billing frequency, and available plans
        are shown in the app at the time of purchase. Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store using your Apple ID
        and are subject to Apple’s terms and policies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage/cancel:</strong> You can manage or cancel via <code>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Trials:</strong> Any free trial converts to a paid subscription unless canceled before the trial ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Payments and refunds are handled by Apple, except where required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9) Acceptable use and safety</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe the Service is being used in a harmful,
        abusive, or unlawful way.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        The Service, including its software, design, branding, and content (excluding user content), is owned by Two Ducks
        and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part
        of the Service without written permission.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        If you submit feedback or suggestions, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use them
        without compensation.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
        AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      </p>

        CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

      <p>
        OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM.
      </p>

      <h2>14) Dispute resolution & arbitration</h2>
      <div class="notice">
        <p>
          <strong>Binding arbitration.</strong> Except for small claims court matters or requests for injunctive relief,
          any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by <strong>binding arbitration</strong>,
          rather than in court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).
          The arbitration will take place in Washington State, unless the parties agree otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No class actions.</strong> You agree that disputes will be brought only in your individual capacity and
          not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>15) Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date reflects the latest version.
        Continued use of the Service means you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>16) Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Service at any time. We may terminate or suspend access for violations of these Terms
        or for safety or legal reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>17) Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to conflict of law principles.
      </p>

      <h2>18) Apple-required notice</h2>
      <div class="notice">
        <p>
          Apple is not a party to these Terms and is not responsible for the Service. Apple has no obligation to provide
          support for the Service. Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce
          them against you.
